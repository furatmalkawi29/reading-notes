## A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.

## Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.

# How to make Table in HTML?

# `<table>` <br>

The `<table>` element is used
to create a table.

<br>

# `<tr>`
The contents
of the table are written out row
by row. `<tr>`
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening `<tr>` tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)

<br>

# `<td>`

It is followed by one or more
`<td>` elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing `</tr>` tag.
`<td>`
Each cell of a table is
represented using a `<td>`
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing `</td>` tag.

<br>

# `<th>`
The `<th>` element is used just
like the `<td>` element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.) 

<br>

# You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
