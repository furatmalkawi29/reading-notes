# [Fixed and liquid Width Layouts]

- Fixed width layouts :

  - do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.

  - Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.



- Liquid width layout:

  - designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. 
  - They tend to
use percentages.
