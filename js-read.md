# How do I creat a Script?

<br>

## 1: DEFINE THE GOAL

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

## 2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT

You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. The flowcharts show the paths between each step.

# EXPRESSIONS

  An expression results in a single value. There are two types of expressions:
  <br>

### 1.EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE: 

<br>

`var color = 'beige' ;`


### 2.EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE:

<br>

`var area = 3 * 2;`

# OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

<br>

### 1.ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

`color = 'beige';`

### 2.ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

`area = 3 * 2;`

### 3.STRING OPERATORS

`greeting= 'Hi 1' + 'Mol ly'`

### 4.COMPARISON OPERATORS
