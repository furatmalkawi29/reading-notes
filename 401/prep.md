<br><br>

## 1. Read the problem completely twice.

You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

<br><br>

## 2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of  sample data.

- Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!

- It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate

<br><br>

## 3. Optimize the manual steps.

 It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.

 <br><br>

## 4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like

 <br><br>

## 5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

 <br><br>


## 6. Optimize the real code.

# How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

### “The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul

### So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

## Here are the steps: 

## 1. Understand

How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

<br><br>

## 2. Plan
Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

<br><br>

## 3. Divide

break it into sub-problems. Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest . 

Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.

<br><br>


## 4. Stuck?

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. 

- Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it.
