  ## Common Terminology :

### Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
 
 ###  K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. 

 ###  Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children

 ###  Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

# Binary trees 

Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two .

they have no specific sorting order for a binary tree.

 ## Binary Search Trees
 
 A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. 
 
 In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

## K-ary Trees. 

If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree.

 In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.

## binary search . 

done based on concept of binary tree where we compare the value with each node and traversing left and right after comparing the value with tree nodes
