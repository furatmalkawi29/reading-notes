# Linked List 

## Linked list?

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## Types of linked list

Singly and Doubly link lists 


## singly link list ?

 A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

## what it measures?

 a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

## alogorithm at big scale ?

  what if instead of ten numbers, we had ten thousand? Or a million? Or tens of millions? Thatâ€™s exactly what Big O Notation takes into account: the speed and efficiency with which something functions when its input grows to be any (crazy big!) size.
