# Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development 

### 1. Better program design and higher code quality

<br>

When writing tests, programmers first have to define a goal they will achieve with the code piece. Developers estimate an experience it will give and the way it will match with other pieces of the entire code. A developer keeps in mind everything, from an interface to a work plan.



### 2. TDD reduces the time required for project development

<br>

It’s widely known that both web and cross-platform apps like PWAs created with Test Driven Development take longer than ones created without TDD. Some sources mention the difference of about 30 percent.

### 3. Code flexibility and easier maintenance

When writing code, developers strive to get fewer bugs, which considerably influences business spending.

# The case that we would need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite? 
when we are unit-testing , when we want to test block of code independently from result coming from testing other parts . if test A, B are related , and test A fails , test B wont fail .

# What is one downside of Test Driven Development

### 1.The tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand.

### 2. The development of the code is slow. The rapid development of code is not possible because we have to write the test cases first, But it long term the development is very fast. 

### 3. The code of TDD is hard to understand as we know writing a code and writing a code well is different. The functionality of TDD is also not discussed, so many team leads only focus on code coverage and it does not tell you anything about code coverage.

# What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

<br>

ES6 class basically does the work of defining a new object and appending functions to its prototype.	ES5 Function constructors work and look the same but the main difference is observed when the developer uses the Inheritance property.

# Why REST?

- Separation between client and server which helps apps be more scalable. 

- Statelessness which makes API requests very specific and detail-driven. 

- Cacheable, which lets clients save data so they don't have to constantly query servers.

## SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences

* SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

* SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases

* SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

* SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) 

### Examples:

* SQL : Oracle ,MySQL Community Edition

* NoSQL : MongoDB , CouchDB
