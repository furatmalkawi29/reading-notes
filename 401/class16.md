### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app and also traces the responses .


###  Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

In basic web interactions, the ‘asker’ is a client and the ‘producer’ is a server. Clients send Requests (HTTP Request) to Servers asking for some kind of information. UServer reads the Request. 

It knows how to read it because it is formatted as an HTTP Request.

The Server generates an HTTP Response to that Request and send it to the client .

 operating systems :

softwares that are able to control computer's hardware . 

<br>

 hypervisor (virtual machine manager):

software that allows us run several operating systems on our machine's operating system . 

example: running windows10 and linux OS on our mac OS 

- uses: 
1.  using old outdated applications 
2.  testing apps performence on several OS 

<br>

cloud computing: 

- the provided service of using the power of a distant server to empower our local machine . 

<br>

Virtiualization benifits: 

- allows us expabds our computer's abilities (hardware) .
  
- replaces the power of several machines by one one distant server .
- central managment : instead of managing several machines one by one , you manage them from a center server 


<br><br>

- cloud computing platform provided by Amazon
- offers cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools .
- can be used for deploying and managing web apps .
  

 Elastic beanstalk
-  service from amazon (used to lunch app/servers/...)
