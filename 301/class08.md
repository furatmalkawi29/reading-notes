# What is SQL?

### SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. 

### - SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

# SQL databases?

### SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

### - All of them support the common SQL language standard,  but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

# Whats Relational databases?

### - collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.

### - Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

# Example?
 ### Department of Motor Vehicles had a database, you might find a table containing all the known vehicles that people in the state are driving. This table might need to store the model name, type, number of wheels, and number of doors of each vehicle for example.

### In such a database, you might find additional related tables containing information such as a list of all registered drivers in the state, the types of driving licenses that can be granted, or even driving violations for each driver.

# Queries?
### By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data, like "What types of vehicles are on the road have less than four wheels?", or "How many models of cars does Tesla produce?", to help us make better decisions down the road.
