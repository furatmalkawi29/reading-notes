# Pair Programming



## How does pair programming work?

### pair programming commonly involves two roles:

### 1. the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.

### 2. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 

<br>

### The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code

<br><br>

## Why pair programing?

## 1. Greater efficiency

### - Pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesnâ€™t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging


<br>

### - When the pair is stuck, both programmers can research the problem

## 2. Engaged collaboration

### - It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work. 

<br>

### - When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help.


## 3. Learning from fellow students

### - pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

<br><br>

## 4. Social skills

### - Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. 

### - This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. 

## 5. Job interview readiness

### - A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen.

<br><br>

###

## 6. Work environment readiness

### - Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
