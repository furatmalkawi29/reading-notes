# Javascript Templating


## What's JS Templeting?

### - Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

<br><br>


## Mustache ?

### - It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.

<br>

## Mustache.JS ?

### - It's an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript.

### - It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. 

``` js
Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
// returns: Hello, Sherlynn
```

# Flex-box

### Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

### - Block, for sections in a webpage
### - Inline, for text
### -Table, for two-dimensional table data
### -Positioned, for explicit position of an element

<br>

### The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.


### There are 2 kinds of flex box properties :

## 1. Flex Container (parent) properties

<br>

### 1. flex-direction
defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.

<br>

### 2. flex-wrap
 specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.

<br>

### 3. flex-flow
The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.


<br>


### 4. justify-content
The justify-content property is used to align the flex items:

 order property specifies the order of the flex items.

### 2. flex-grow

### 4. flex-basis
specifies the initial length of a flex item.
### 5. align-self
specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container.
