# Why diversity matters in tech comapanies?

## 1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 

### Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.

## 2. Diverse companies perform better

### - Research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

###  - Many tech companies pride themselves on creating environments where "the best idea wins." By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table. 


## 3. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 

### - When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.

### - Tracy Chou, Pinterest explained: "We improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and have same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests"


## 4. It’s the right thing to do 

### - Cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.

### - Excluding certain groups from opportunities in the industry is form of  existing social inequality

### For company leaders beginning to consider diversity and inclusion, understanding these rationales and identifying one that resonates for you and your organization can be a helpful first step.
