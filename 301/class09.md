# Functional Programming

## programming technique / paragdim 

### - functional programming concepts like immutability and pure functions are big advantages to build side-effect-free functions .

## 1- Pure functions

### - It returns the same result if given the same arguments . function is dependent from external global variables, all what it needs is passed as arguments . Makes the code  easier to test. 

## 2- Immutability

### - Keeping variables immutable after itâ€™s created. For example in for loops, instead of incrementing i index , you use recursion .


## 3- Referential transparency

### - pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency


## 4- Functions as first-class entities

### - Functions as first-class entities can:
### - refer to it from constants and variables
### - pass it as a parameter to other functions
### - return it as result from other functions

## - Why? 

### combine different functions to create new functions with new behavior.


## 5- Higher-order functions

### - takes one or more functions as arguments, or

### - returns a function as its result

## - Example of higher order functions are method arrays : 

```
map() , reduce () , filter ()
```
