# What Is Node.js?

# JavaScript Package Manager , npm

### has over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download

# Benifits of node.js ?

## 1) node.js, is event-driven

###  - supports  asynchronous behavior.

###  - everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. 
 
###  - example, when a new request comes in, the server will start processing it. 
 
###  - If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation (process that took long time), instead of waiting for this to complete, it will be continuing to process the next event. 
 
###  - When original request processing has finished, the server  continue working on it . 

## 2) It speaks JSON . 

### No need for reformating data while exchanging it between server-client sides .

# Downsides?

### Some developers dislike the callback-based style of coding that JavaScript imposes . But with the arrival of native Promises, followed closely by async await, it became easier than it ever was.
